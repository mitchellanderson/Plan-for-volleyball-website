<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Mitchell Anderson</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is to help the volleyball club Slammers improve their business by getting around about 100 people playing at Slammers each week. This benefits the client because it will increase customers by at least 50%.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The client will be informed of the websites success by the growing numbers of sign up forms that will be submitted by the public.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience that the client wants to appeal to are the younger audience, they want to get kids playing while in high school. The client has stated the age bracket between the years (15 &ndash; 30)</p>
<p>To cater for this audience the website will be designed on focusing on the main important information the audience may be interested in as well as still have the option to read more information if they want to. It is known younger generations have shorter attention spans, so getting to the information quickly about how they could enjoy volleyball and what the club has to offer and where to sign up will be the main information.</p>
